            <div class="accordion-content-container">
              <p>A corporate apartment is a fully furnished apartment without the commitment of a year-long lease which rental buildings require. Cornerstone Furnished Solutions provides fully furnished temporary housing for any number of reasons including: business travelers, human resource/relocation departments, military assignments, government personnel and vacation travelers. We also work closely with the insurance industry to accommodate displaced homeowners in need of temporary furnished housing. Whatever your need may be, we can help!</p>

            <h3 class="accordion-trigger">Corporate Housing vs Staying At A Hotel?<span class="fa fa-fw fa-plus icons accordion-icon"></span></h3>
            <div class="accordion-content-container">
              <p>As opposed to staying at a hotel, corporate housing enables you to stay in a fully furnished full-sized apartment that you can really call home. You can set-up temporary residence and receive mail at this location, and truly call your corporate apartment your "home away from home". You will have a full-sized kitchen with a refrigerator, oven, microwave and stove, and a full-size washer/dryer in all of our apartments. Plus, you get to enjoy all of the resort style amenities which include: pools, clubrooms, fitness centers, business centers and so much more.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content-container">
              <p>Most locations have a 30-day minimum length of stay, after the initial 30 days you can stay as long as you like. In addition, if you depart mid-month, you will only be charged for the additional days you stay (not the entire month). Once past the initial 30 days, we work around your schedule!</p>
